I have attached a photo of the current Next.js component I am working on for my project. I would like you to take the following LocoFy autogenerate code for this component and optimize it so that it conforms to the Next.js project I am working on. For now I want to add the CSS in-line to see what it looks like but in the future I will separate all the CSS into a separate file, so please optimize for that. Please try to make the styles as close as possible to what is in the photo. I want this component to be confined into a grey box/tile with rounded edges so that it stands out from the background. Further, I need to make sure that the code conforms to best professional standards (mobile friendly, concise code) and optimizes accessibility above all else. This file will be called XXXXXX.tsx
